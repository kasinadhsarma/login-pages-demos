# Project Goals and Requirements

## 1. Core Authentication Features
- [ ] Login system
- [ ] Signup functionality
- [ ] Forgot password flow
- [ ] Responsive design (web/mobile compatible)

## 2. Performance Goals
- [ ] O(1) UX latency optimization
- [ ] Minimized API response times
- [ ] Efficient client-side rendering

## 3. Security Implementation
### Password Hashing (Researched)
- [ ] Implement Argon2id (primary choice)
  - Modern, memory-hard algorithm
  - Recommended for maximum security
- [ ] Alternatives considered:
  - PBKDF2 (backup option)
  - Bcrypt (legacy support)

## 4. Database Design
- [ ] User authentication table
- [ ] Session management
- [ ] Token storage
- [ ] Audit logging
- Status: Currently researching optimal solution

## 5. API Architecture
- [ ] FastAPI endpoints implementation
- [ ] RESTful API design
- [ ] Swagger documentation
- [ ] Rate limiting

## 6. Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Lazy loading
  - Implemented for forgot password flow
- [ ] Payload optimization
  - FormData compression
  - JSON minimization
- [ ] Token caching strategy
- [ ] Analytics monitoring
  - Performance metrics
  - Error tracking
  - Usage statistics

## 7. Advanced Authentication
- [ ] Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
  - SMS verification
  - Email verification
  - Authenticator app support
- [ ] OAuth Integration
  - Google
  - GitHub
  - Social login providers

## Progress Tracking
- ðŸŸ¢ Completed
